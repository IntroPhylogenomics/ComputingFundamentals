# Changing File Extensions

Let's say you have a whole series of files that end with the extension .txt
and you'd like to rename them to have .text extensions. But, you don't know
how many .txt files you might have or what their names will be. Thankfully,
this is where wildcards become incredibly helpful. Remember that the bash shell uses 
a single `*` as its most general wildcard. So, typing `*.txt` will automatically give 
you all the filenames that end with .txt.

Note that there's a special command called basename that strips off whatever text 
you want from the end of a string. So, typing

`basename test.txt .txt`

will give you just `test` in return.

See if you can create a script that uses a `for` loop to go through all
of the .txt files in a folder and give them the extension of .text.
