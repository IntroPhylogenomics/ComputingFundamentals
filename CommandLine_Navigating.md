# Navigating at the Command Line

## Terminal

The filesystem on Unix-based systems can be accessed not only through the point-and-click graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that we're all used to, but also by typing text commands. These commands are entered through an interface called the Terminal. On Mac OS X, Terminal can be found in `Applications > Utilities`. After opening Terminal, you can type commands at the command prompt (which usually ends with `>` or `$`).
