# Calculator Script

Write a script that accepts some set of numbers on the command line (you set the rules for how many). Have the script perform a set of mathematical operations on the numbers, then print out the result.

As well as comments, try to "dummy proof" your script. What will it do if someone provides the number of command-line arguments, or arguments that would produce non-sensical results (like dividing by 0).
