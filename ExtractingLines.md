# Extracting Specific Lines from Files

(1) Try writing a Bash script to extract only the 30th line from all the `.txt` files in a folder, and make a new file that stores these lines.

(2) Let's say you have a series of files that all start with one header line at the top (containing column labels). You'd like to keep the header lines and all lines _except_ the first 10 after the header. Try writing a script to do this. You will probably want to use `head`, `tail`, `|`, and `wc`.

You can make up your own example files to test your solutions for these problems, but we can also provide them if you'd prefer.
