## Practical Computing Tips

### Naming files and folders

Developing good habits (and breaking bad ones) for naming files and folders will 
make your life much easier in the long run. Many computing errors result from code 
just having trouble reading names properly. The most important rule is to NEVER use 
spaces! Doing so will frequently cause programs to only read part of the name. Also, 
it's a good idea to avoid special characters (like $, \*, @, etc.) whenever possible. 
Some widely used approaches to filename syntax are:

- CamelCaseLooksLikeThis
- underscores_can_work

```
Find a style that you like and stick with it. Consistency helps a lot.

### Plain text files
	
```
Nearly all files that you'll use for storing data and results in phylogenomics or 
bioinformatics are plain text files. These files may have special names (like Nexus
files - .nex), but these names just mean that these text files have been formatted 
according to a particular set of requirements. They can all be opened by a text 
editor and are human readable. These files store characters using widely accepted
standards like ASCII and UniCode.

- [UTF-8 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)

```
Note that more specialized and proprietary file types (like .jpg, .pdf, .docx) are 
not plain text and, therefore, are not human readable.
