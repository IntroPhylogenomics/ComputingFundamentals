## Practical Computing Tips

#### Naming files and folders

```
Developing good habits (and breaking bad ones) for naming files and folders will 
make your life much easier in the long run. Many computing errors result from code 
just having trouble reading names properly. The most important rule is to NEVER use 
spaces! Doing so will frequently cause programs to only read part of the name. Also, 
it's a good idea to avoid special characters (like $, *, @, etc.) whenever possible. 
Some widely used approaches to filename syntax are:
```

- CamelCaseLooksLikeThis
- underscores_can_work

#### Plain text files
	
- Human readable
- ASCII and UniCode
	- [ASCII on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
	- [UTF-8 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)

#### New line characters

#### Activity Monitor
	- CPU Activity
	- Memory
	- Disk spaces
	- Jobs and IDs
  
## Filesystem Structure
  
- The Unix root (/)
	- The very base of the filesystem
- Absolute paths
	- All absolute paths begin at the root- start with /
- Relative paths
	- dont start with /
	- Working directories
	- Shortcuts for current and parent directories
- Hidden files and folders
	- Names begin with `.`
	- Usually used for configuration files
