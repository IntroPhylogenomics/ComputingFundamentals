# Editing Files and Folders from the Command Line

## Copying, Moving, and Renaming

You will often need to copy or rename a file from the command line. To copy a file inside your current working directory, you can use the copy command - `cp`. For instance, if you want to make a copy of a data file for a new analysis, you could use

`cp myData.txt myNewData.txt` - copy a file

You can also make copies that end up in other folders by adding a relative or absolute path before the filename

`cp myData.txt ../myNewData.txt` - copy data to the parent of current working directory

Moving and renaming files uses the same command - `mv`. If the source and destination filenames are in the same folder (e.g., the current working directory) then `mv` will simply rename the file

`mv myData.txt myOldData.txt` - rename `myData.txt` to `myOldData.txt`

However, if the source and destination filenames reference different folders, then `mv` will move the file

`mv myData.txt ..` - move `myData.txt` to parent of current working directory

You can also use `mv` to simultaneously move and rename a file

`mv myData.txt ../myOldData.txt` - both moves and renames myData.txt

## Creating New Files and Folders

To create a new file on the command line, there are a few options. The easiest is to use the `touch` command. For instance, to create a new file called `test.txt`, you could use

`touch test.txt` - create `test.txt`

This will create a new, empty text file called test.txt in your current working directory. You can also provide a path (absolute or relative) in the argument to `touch` to specify another location, for example

`touch Desktop/test.txt` - create `test.txt` in the `Desktop` folder

The equivalent command for creating a new folder is `mkdir`. To create a new, empty folder in the current working directory, type

`mkdir myFolder` - create new folder called myFolder.

Files, but not folders, can also be created by using one of text editors available directly through the command line. Probably the simplest of these editors is called `nano`. To start `nano`, simply type its name

`nano` - open the `nano` text editor

Note that when you start `nano`, your Terminal will change appearance so that you no longer see the standard command line. Instead, you will be inside a `nano` editing window. As you type, your text will be added to your text file as it would in any other program. You should also see a series of available commands at the bottom that start with `^`. That symbol simply indicates that you should hold down the control button and then the relevant letter to execute that command. For instance, to save your text file without quitting `nano`, hold down control and type `o` (lowercase is fine). You will then be prompted to enter a filename. When you're ready, press return and the file will be saved with that name. To exit `nano` and return to the standard command prompt, hold down control and type `x`.

Other, more advanced, text editors like `vi` and `emacs` are also available on many Unix systems, but we won't need their functionality for this course.

## Viewing and Editing File Contents

In addition to creating new files, `nano` can be used to edit existing files. To do this, simply add the name of the file as a command-line argument

`nano myFile.txt` - open `myFile.txt` in `nano` for editing

A list of keyboard shortcuts for `nano` can be found [here](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html).

## Deleting Files (CAREFUL!!)
